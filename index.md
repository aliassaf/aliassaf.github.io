I am a software engineer working on YouTube at [Google Zurich](http://www.google.ch/about/careers/locations/zurich/).

Before joining Google, I did research in theoretical computer science. I received my PhD from Ã‰cole Polytechnique after working at [Inria](http://www.inria.fr/) in the [Deducteam](http://deducteam.gforge.inria.fr/) group under the supervision of [Gilles Dowek](http://www.lsv.fr/~dowek/) on the interoperabilty of proof systems.

My general research topics are **programming languages**, **logic**, and **computation**. I am interested in the links between programming and logic, in the design and implementation of programming languages, and the development of tools for the verification of programs and the formalization of mathematics. My weapon of choice is formal methods, in particular *type systems* and *proof theory*.
